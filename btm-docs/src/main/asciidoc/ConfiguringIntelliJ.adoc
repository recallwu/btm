= Configuring IntelliJ IDE

Follow these steps to configure IntelliJ IDE for btm development.  These guide assumes you have already downloaded and built the source successfully with Maven.

****
Note: The following steps apply to the Bitronix 2.2 development branch, not prior releases.

== Step 1

Start the IntelliJ IDE, and select "New Project..." from the File menu.

* Set the "Root directory" to point to your GIT directory that contains the bitronix project.  In the example above, "/Users/brettw/Documents/dev/bitronix"
* Select the checkbox to keep your project files in a separate directory, and select a directory.  In the example above, "/Users/brettw/Documents/intellij".
* Select the checkbox to "Import Maven projects automatically".
* Select the checkbox to "Create module groups for multi-module Maven projects".
* Click "Next".

The defaults should be fine here, just click "Finish".
Your project tree should now look like this:

== Step 2
Now we're going to setup the module paths so that IntelliJ can build with both JDBC3 and JDBC4 at the same time.
Right-click on the bitronix project in the project tree, and choose "Open Module Settings" from the menu.  A window like this should open:

Now, perform these steps for the "btm" module:

- Select the "btm" module in the second pane from the left.
- Click on the "Dependencies" tab for the btm module.
- Select the "btm-jdbc3-stubs" dependency, and move it up, above the Java VM dependency ("1.6 (java version 1.6.0_26)" in the screenshot, possibly "1.5" in your environment).
- The result should look like this:

In IntelliJ, dependencies that appear after the JDK are added to the classpath, and dependencies that appear before the JDK are added to the bootclasspath.
Now, perform these steps for the "btm-jdbc4" module:

- Select the "btm-jdbc4" module in the second pane from the left.
- Click on the "Dependencies" tab for the btm-jdbc4 module.
- Select the "btm-jdbc4-stubs" dependency, and move it up, above the Java VM dependency ("1.6 (java version 1.6.0_26)" in the screenshot, possibly "1.5" in your environment).
- The result should look like this:

Ok, you're done!  Now, click "OK" to dismiss the module settings dialog.

== Step 3

Click on the "Build" menu, and select "Rebuild Project".  The projects should now build without error.

*Happy developing!  The Bitronix Team welcomes your contribution.*
